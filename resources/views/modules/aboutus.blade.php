                                offers features such as access to the Bible, smart search, bookmarking, 
                                speech-to-text, and text-to-speech capabilities. Through this evaluation, 
                                we aim to assess the effectiveness and usability of these features, with
                                a focus on improving accessibility and functionality. Our research seeks

                                to diverse needs and enhance the user experience. By advancing technology
                                in religious contexts, we aim to make accessing and engaging with the Bible
                                more convenient and effective for all individuals.</button>
